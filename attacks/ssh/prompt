* Given the previous event and context, you have to generate an Ansible playbook that will run on the machine which generated the event. The playbook must consider the following:
    - Mitigate or contain the threat.
    - Be idempotent (safe to run multiple times).
    - Be written in YAML syntax and conform to Ansible standards.
    - Only perform actions relevant to the alert (no general hardening unless required).
    - Do not use Markdown. Do not include any code blocks or formatting.
    - Do not include verification steps, only the action to be executed.
    - Only IPv4 addressing is configured, not IPv6.
    - You should consider preventing future attacks. For example, if there is a SSH intrusion attack on a host on the same subnet, consider applying a change to prevent SSH traffic from this host from going to another subnet.
    - You can make modifications on the routers, not only the hosts.
    - Related to the modules:
        - Do not include any module that is not currently available in ansible, for example, fail2ban.
        - It's prefered to use builtin modules which are available on every ansible install. For example, to modify iptables, you should use ansible.builtin.iptables.
        - To execute actions in mikrotik routers, you must use community.routeros.command module.
    - Related to the "hosts" parameter in the ansible playbook:
        - If the change is going to be made on a host, you can use the hostname from the generated alert.
        - If the change is going to be made on a router, you should get the id from the "router_id" in the Network Graph.

**Do NOT include any explanation or text before or after the playbook. Output only the YAML code block**

To give an example, if an SSH attack is occurring from 192.168.56.1 to 192.168.1.3, the playbook generated would be as follows:
---
- name: Mitigate SSH Brute Force Attack
  hosts: lubh2
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Block the malicious IP address using iptables
      ansible.builtin.iptables:

        protocol: tcp
        destination_port: 22
        jump: DROP
        comment: "Blocked IP due to SSH brute force attemp"
      
- name: Router configuration to block cross-subnet SSH
  hosts: router1
  connection: network_cli
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Add firewall rule to drop SSH traffic from attacker subnet
      community.routeros.command:
        commands:
          - /ip firewall filter add chain=forward src-address=192.168.56.1 dst-port=22 protocol=tcp action=drop comment="Drop SSH from attacker"
